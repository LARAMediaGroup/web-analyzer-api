# TheVou Editor Guide: Using the Web Analyzer Plugin

This guide will help TheVou.com editors use the Web Analyzer plugin to create effective internal links in fashion content.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Plugin

The Web Analyzer plugin integrates directly into your WordPress editor:

1. **In Block Editor (Gutenberg)**: Click the "Web Analyzer" icon in the top-right toolbar or select it from the "More Tools" menu
2. **In Classic Editor**: Look for the "Web Analyzer" meta box below the content editor

### When to Use the Plugin

For best results, use Web Analyzer:

- After completing your article draft (at least 80% complete)
- When publishing new content that could link to existing articles
- When updating older content to add links to newer articles
- During content audits to improve internal linking structure

## Using the Block Editor Integration

### Analyzing Content

1. Open the Web Analyzer sidebar by clicking the "Web Analyzer" icon
2. Click the "Analyze Content" button
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (typically 5-10 seconds)
4. Review the suggested links that appear in the sidebar

### Working with Link Suggestions

Each suggestion includes:

- **Anchor Text**: The text that will become a link
- **Confidence Score**: How relevant the link is (higher is better)
- **Context**: Where the link fits in your content
- **Target URL**: The destination page

### Inserting Links

You have three options for inserting links:

1. **Find & Insert**: 
   - Click "Find" to locate where the anchor text appears in your content
   - The editor will highlight and select that text block
   - Click "Insert" to automatically add the link

2. **Insert at Cursor**:
   - Place your cursor where you want the link
   - Click "At Cursor" to insert both the anchor text and link

3. **Manual Insertion**:
   - Copy the suggested anchor text
   - Highlight relevant text in your content
   - Use the standard WordPress link tool

### Best Practices for TheVou Content

- **Aim for 3-7 internal links** per article (depending on length)
- **Prioritize links to cornerstone content** about body shapes, color analysis, and style guides
- **Favor high-confidence suggestions** (80%+)
- **Distribute links throughout the article** (not all in one section)
- **Match links to user intent** (link to detailed guides when appropriate)

## Fashion-Specific Link Strategies

### Body Shape Content

When writing about body shapes:
- Link to specific guides for that body shape
- Link to related style guides appropriate for that body shape
- Link to color analysis content that complements the body shape

Example:
> When dressing an **inverted triangle body shape**, focus on balancing your proportions by adding visual weight to your lower body.

### Color Analysis Content

When writing about color analysis:
- Link to seasonal color palette guides
- Link to outfit guides using those colors
- Link to style guides that incorporate color theory

Example:
> Men with a **True Spring color palette** should favor warm, clear colors that reflect the vibrancy of spring.

### Style and Fashion Content

When writing about specific styles:
- Link to related style guides
- Link to body shape advice for that style
- Link to historical or cultural context articles

Example:
> The **Old Money aesthetic** draws inspiration from traditional Ivy League and prep school styles.

## Analyzing Link Performance

The Web Analyzer plugin includes analytics to help you understand which links perform best:

1. Go to Web Analyzer > Analytics in the WordPress admin
2. View the "Link Performance" tab
3. Sort by clicks, CTR, or engagement time
4. Use these insights to inform future linking strategies

## Bulk Processing for Content Updates

For efficiency, you can analyze multiple posts at once:

1. Go to Web Analyzer > Bulk Tool in the WordPress admin
2. Select the posts you want to analyze
3. Click "Start Analysis"
4. Review and apply suggestions through the bulk interface
